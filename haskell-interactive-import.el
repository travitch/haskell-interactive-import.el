;;;  Commentary:

;; This package implements a minor mode for Haskell mode that adds a hydra for
;; interactively inserting imports and returning to the original point before
;; the import was started.  The interactive hydra interface allows the user to
;; select the import group to which the import should be added.
;;
;; Imports in the target group are sorted automatically.
;;
;; Example configuration:
;;
;; (use-package haskell-interactive-import
;;   :ensure nil
;;   :load-path "~/.emacs.d/local"
;;   :init (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'haskell-interactive-import-mode))

;;; Code:

(require 'hydra)
(require 'haskell-mode)
(require 'eacl)

(defhydra hydra-haskell-interactive-import (:hint nil)
  "Add Import"
  ("i" haskell-navigate-imports-go "Next import group")
  ("RET" exit-recursive-edit "Import here")
  ("q" nil "Quit"))

;;;###autoload
(defun haskell-interactive-import-begin ()
  "Interactively select an import group and add an import to it."
  (interactive)

      (call-interactively #'hydra-haskell-interactive-import/body)
      (recursive-edit)
      (insert "\n")
      (forward-line -1)
      (insert "import ")
      (eacl-complete-line)
      (haskell-sort-imports))))

    (set-keymap-parent map haskell-mode-map)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c i") #'haskell-interactive-import-begin)
    map)
  "Keymap for Haskell mode hydras.")
