* Overview
This package adds an interactive command, ~haskell-interactive-import-begin~, which allows the user to interactively select an import group to which a new import will be added.  Currently, the import is chosen using [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/eacl][eacl]].  Imports in the chosen group are sorted after the import is added.

The function returns the point to the original location before the function was executed.  It also cleans up any buffer modifications if the interaction is aborted.

* Future improvements

- Add other hydra entries for adding imports not based on completion
